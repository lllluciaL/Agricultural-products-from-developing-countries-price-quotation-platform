The Agricultural Products Price Quotation Platform for Developing Countries is an online platform designed to help agricultural product market participants understand and analyze global agricultural product price trends. By displaying price data of agricultural products in various countries, it helps farmers, agricultural product traders and policymakers understand the price changes of different commodities in different markets, and provides predictions of future price trends. This will help promote trade in agricultural products, optimize the relationship between supply and demand, increase farmers' income, and provide decision-making support for the government to formulate agricultural policies.
